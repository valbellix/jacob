Just Another COde Browser
=========================

About
-----
Just Another COde Browser (aka jacob) is a Sublime Text 3 plugin that helps in code browsing. It works in a very naive way, leveraging on ST3 symbol indexer. It means that can browse through anything that can be indexed by ST3, and it does not need any third-parties software installed. You can obviously do this using CTags, but this is what I would like to avoid. Anyway CTags offer more than mere code browsing, and if you want something more elaborated you may want to use it, but what I really want to do is to browse my own code without having huge ctags files. As a matter of fact, this plugin offers a quicker way to use the `Go to symbol in project` feature that can be either accessed from the `Goto` menu or from `Cmd+Shift+R` in Mac OS X, and `Ctrl+Shift+R` in Windows and Linux.

Installation and setup
----------------------
There is really little to do to set up jacob. If you have git installed, just clone this repository into your ST3 package directory. Usually you can find this directory in:

* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages`
* OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`
* Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages`
* Portable Installation: `Sublime Text 3/Data/Packages`

Just clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/valbellix/jacob.git

Et voil√†! jacob is ready to work for you.

You can install this plugin manually downloading it [here](https://github.com/valbellix/jacob/archive/master.zip) and unzipping into its location (see above).

Usage
-----
Be on the symbol you need to look for, and press `ctrl+shift+period`. If your ST3 index has more than one location, a panel will show you where it is, otherwise it will navigate directly to the symbol definition. You can also use this keyboard+mouse combo: `ctrl+alt+right-click`.

To navigate back, just `ctrl+shift+comma`, or `ctrl+alt+right-click`.
